    <h2> Buying This Beauty </h2>
     
       <p>
        I was lost in the stress of work never taking a break from my job and one day I looked at my cousin and said I wanna buy a boat.
       I looked on cragislist that day and found this beauty. I believe it was supposed to happen. 
       When we arrived the guy said it was a good boat he got for his girls to play with in the canal;
       but they wanted a boat they could get pulled behind in a tube. I purchased the boat and could not stop smiling all the way home. 
       My brain was spinning thinking about how do I want to build it out.
       </p>

    <h2> Customizing the Boat</h2>
        
       <p>
          I started off by removing the bow of the boat and the two benches with a angle grinder.
          The bout still had a stearing wheel although it was not connected. The boat came with a 14hp mercury out board motor.
          Then I got 2x4's and reinforced the floor of the boat and build the frame for the deck.
          Once the frame was done I layed plywood down and built the bench for my seats and cut a hold for the gas tank.
          Then I layed marrien cappet down and installed the seats. The third seat(the one up at the front) 
          came off one day while i was leaning to far back. I reinforced the seat since.
          There was a bimini top I installed but it broke off when I didnt properly strap it down on the way home one day.
          I added a metal box to keep organized but its heavy so I will be thinking of a replacement. Most of my items are under the deck that has more than enough room.
        </p>

    <h2> The Results</h2>
        <p>
          I have a way to get away from town where I can think and be closer to my spiritual side.
          I have had friends and family come out. Building this boat is one of the best things I have done in while.
          Although I call it a fishing boat I use it more for a ecape from the city.
